# StockFlowPro - Comprehensive Codebase Analysis (Consolidated)

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the StockFlowPro inventory management system, identifying gaps, missing features, and critical improvements needed to transform the current implementation into a fully functional application.

## Current State of the Codebase

### Strengths
- Next.js 14 App Router implementation

- Manager assignments
- Advanced filtering
- Detailed views and statistics

### 6. Settings & Configuration
#### Current Status
- Stub implementation
- No functional settings persistence

#### Required Improvements
- Comprehensive settings tabs
- Persistent configuration
- Role-based setting access

### 7. Analytics & Calculators
#### Current Status
- Placeholder pages
- No actual data processing
- No calculation logic

#### Required Improvements
- Implement functional charts
- Add calculation algorithms
