Codebase for StockFlowPro - a real-time inventory management system, 

---
CODEBASE VS REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
----

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements

The prompt outlines a comprehensive inventory management system with:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with five roles (Admin, Supervisor, Storeman, Clerk, Supplier).
- **Dashboard**: Role-specific views with summary cards, charts, and pending approvals.
- **Inventory Management**: Filtering, sorting, searching, and transaction initiation.
- **Transaction Workflows**: Receipt, Issuance, Transfer, Swap with multi-stage approvals.
- **Storeroom & User Management**: CRUD operations for storerooms and users.
- **Settings & Analytics**: Configurable settings and data visualizations.
- **Technical Features**: Real-time updates, glassmorphic UI, TypeScript, Next.js, Supabase integration, etc.

The current code provides a foundation but lacks full implementation of many features.

### Step 2: Analyze the Current Codebase

#### What’s Present:
1. **Directory Structure**: Matches the prompt’s specification with Next.js App Router, components, and UI libraries (shadcn/ui).
2. **Frontend Framework**: Uses Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.
3. **Authentication**: Basic login form (`LoginForm.tsx`) with mock session management in `page.tsx`.
4. **UI Components**: Extensive set of reusable components from shadcn/ui.
5. **Pages**: Initial implementations for dashboard, inventory, transactions, approvals, analytics, calculator, etc.
6. **Database Integration**: Supabase client setup (`supabase.ts`) with type definitions (`database.types.ts`) and basic queries.
7. **Styling**: Glassmorphic design partially implemented via Tailwind CSS.

#### What’s Incomplete or Missing:
Let’s break this down by feature area.

---

### Step 3: List of Things Lacking or Missing

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Missing Backend Authentication**: The login system uses `localStorage` with a mock timeout, not Supabase Auth (`signInWithPassword` is defined but unused).
- **No Role-Based Route Protection**: `AuthLayout.tsx` exists but isn’t implemented to restrict access based on roles.
- **No Session Management**: No proper session handling or refresh token logic.
- **No Sign-Up**: User registration is not implemented.
- **No Password Recovery**: Missing forgot password/reset functionality.

#### 2. Dashboard
- **Incomplete Data Fetching**: `getInventoryItems` and `getStorerooms` are called, but many summary metrics (pending transactions, recent activity) use hardcoded values.
- **Missing Charts**: `InventoryStatusChart.tsx` exists but lacks actual chart implementation (Recharts is imported but unused).
- **No Real-Time Updates**: No WebSocket or polling for live data.
- **Limited Role-Specific Views**: Dashboard doesn’t adapt content based on user role beyond basic props.

#### 3. Inventory Management
- **Incomplete Inventory Table**: `InventoryTable.tsx` exists but lacks filtering, sorting, searching, and context menu for transactions.
- **No CRUD Operations**: Can’t add/edit/delete items or inventory records.
- **No Stock Status Logic**: Missing logic to calculate "Low Stock" or "Out of Stock" dynamically beyond basic filtering.
- **No Transaction Initiation**: `TransactionInitiator.tsx` is a stub without functionality.

#### 4. Transaction Workflows
- **Incomplete Forms**: Transaction forms (`IssuanceForm.tsx`, etc.) exist but lack full implementation (e.g., no item selection, validation, or submission logic).
- **No Approval Workflow**: Multi-stage approval process is defined in the database but not implemented in the UI.
- **No Status Tracking**: Transaction status (draft, pending, approved, rejected) isn’t fully functional.
- **No Document Upload**: Document management for transactions is missing.

#### 5. Storeroom Management
- **Basic Page Only**: `storeroom/page.tsx` shows a list but lacks editing, adding, or detailed views.
- **No Manager Assignment**: Can’t assign managers to storerooms.

#### 6. User Management
- **Basic List**: `users/page.tsx` shows users but lacks add/edit/delete functionality and filtering.
- **No Department Management**: Department field exists but isn’t utilized.

#### 7. Settings
- **Stub Implementation**: `settings/page.tsx` exists but lacks tabs and actual settings (e.g., notifications, security).

#### 8. Analytics
- **Placeholder Charts**: `analytics/page.tsx` has placeholders instead of functional Recharts visualizations.
- **No Data Processing**: No logic to calculate turnover, stock levels, or transaction volume.

#### 9. Calculators
- **No Calculation Logic**: `calculator/page.tsx` has UI but no formulas for Reorder Point or EOQ.

#### 10. Technical Features
- **No Real-Time Updates**: WebSockets or Supabase real-time subscriptions aren’t implemented.
- **Mock Data**: Relies on mock data instead of full Supabase integration.
- **No Error Handling**: Limited error states and recovery mechanisms.
- **No Testing**: No unit, integration, or end-to-end tests despite being specified.
- **Accessibility**: Basic ARIA attributes but no comprehensive a11y testing.

#### 11. Security
- **No Input Validation**: Forms lack server-side validation.
- **No Rate Limiting**: Missing for login attempts.
- **No CSRF Protection**: Not implemented in mock auth.

### Step 4: List of Things to Fix or Put in Place
#### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Integrate Supabase Auth**: Replace mock login with `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` and handle sessions properly.
- **Implement RBAC**: Use `AuthLayout.tsx` to protect routes based on user role fetched from `getUserRole`.
- **Add Session Management**: Implement refresh tokens and auto-logout on expiration.
- **Add Sign-Up**: Create a registration form with role assignment (admin-only for some roles).
- **Add Password Recovery**: Implement email-based password reset.

#### 2. Dashboard
- **Complete Data Fetching**: Fetch all summary data (pending transactions, recent activity) from Supabase.
- **Implement Charts**: Use Recharts in `InventoryStatusChart.tsx` to visualize stock levels.
- **Add Real-Time**: Subscribe to Supabase real-time channels for inventory and transaction updates.
- **Role-Specific Logic**: Dynamically render dashboard components based on user role.

#### 3. Inventory Management
- **Enhance Inventory Table**: Add filtering (storeroom, category, status), sorting, searching, and a context menu using `TransactionInitiator.tsx`.
- **Implement CRUD**: Add API calls to create/update/delete inventory items and records.
- **Dynamic Stock Status**: Calculate stock status in real-time and display visually.

#### 4. Transaction Workflows
- **Complete Forms**: Add item selection, validation with zod, and submission logic to transaction forms.
- **Implement Approval Workflow**: Fetch and update `approval_workflows` table, showing status and allowing approve/reject actions.
- **Track Status**: Update transaction status in UI and database.
- **Add Document Upload**: Integrate Supabase Storage for document management.

#### 5. Storeroom Management
- **Full CRUD**: Implement add/edit/delete for storerooms with manager assignment.
- **Detailed Views**: Show storeroom items and stats.

#### 6. User Management
- **Full CRUD**: Add user creation, editing, and deletion with role/department management.
- **Filtering**: Implement role-based filtering and search.

#### 7. Settings
- **Implement Tabs**: Add functional tabs for general, notifications, security, etc., with save functionality.
- **Persist Settings**: Store settings in Supabase or localStorage.

#### 8. Analytics
- **Functional Charts**: Implement Recharts with real data for turnover, stock levels, and transaction volume.
- **Data Processing**: Add backend queries or client-side logic to process analytics data.

#### 9. Calculators
- **Add Logic**: Implement Reorder Point (`dailyUsage * leadTime + safetyStock`) and EOQ (`sqrt((2 * demand * orderCost) / holdingCost)`).

#### 10. Technical Improvements
- **Real-Time Subscriptions**: Use Supabase real-time for inventory, transactions, and approvals.
- **Replace Mock Data**: Fully integrate Supabase CRUD operations.
- **Error Handling**: Add try/catch blocks, loading states, and user-friendly error messages everywhere.
- **Testing**: Add Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E tests, and test key flows.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast compliance.

#### 11. Security
- **Input Validation**: Use zod server-side and client-side.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement for auth endpoints via Supabase or middleware.
- **CSRF Protection**: Add tokens for form submissions.
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypt sensitive data in Supabase.

#### 12. Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Add stricter TypeScript types for all components and API responses.
- **Refactor**: Break down large components (e.g., `page.tsx`) into smaller, reusable ones.
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments and update README with setup/run instructions.
