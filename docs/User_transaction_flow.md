The transaction now moves to the storeman.

The storeman opens the system and goes to approvals.
* The storeman will check the entry on the system and the quantities delivered to him physically
* The storeman will then approve or reject the transaction based on the information captured on the system and the items infront of him

After the items have been received into the store, the transaction moved to the supervisor who will then approve the transaction
